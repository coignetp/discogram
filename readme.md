# Discogram

Discogram is a very simple discord and telegram bot that only does one thing: Notify on telegram when someone joins / leaves a vocal discord channel.

To run it you will have to specify a [discord token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and a [telegram token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

You will also need the [telegram chat id](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56546442) on which to notify

To run it you simply install the requirements defined in the `requirements.txt` ([discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)):

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

And run `discord.py`:

`python discord.py`
